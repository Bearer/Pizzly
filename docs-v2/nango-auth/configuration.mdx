## Custom Callback URL

You can change the callback URL of Nango if you want to personalize it (e.g. use your own domain).

If you are using Nango Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Add a new endpoint in your app, e.g. `https://EXAMPLE.com/oauth-callback`. All requests to this endpoint should redirect to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and **pass along all original parameters**. The easiest way to do this is with a 308 redirect.
2. Change the registered OAuth callback URL with all API providers. Otherwise they will refuse new flows!
3. When you are ready change your Nango callback URL in the [project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings)

<Warning>
Before saving the custom callback URL in Nango, ensure that:

-   the callback URL redirects to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and passes along all parameters (e.g. 308 redirect)
-   your OAuth app, as registered with the external API provider, has the new callback URL whitelisted

</Warning>

If you are self-hosting Nango, follow the instructions [here](/self-host/instructions) to change your callback URL.

## Connection configuration

Some API Providers require connection-specific configuration variables (e.g. Zendesk, Shopify, Qualtrics, Contentstack).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is specific to a user's Zendesk account:

```
https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new
```

To specify the subdomain, pass in an additional configuration object to `nango.auth()`:

```javascript
nango.auth('zendesk', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {
    params: { 
        subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' 
    }
});
```

You can find which configuration parameters are necessary for your [Connection](/core-concepts#connections) in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) file.

## Connection metadata

During the OAuth flow, certain APIs return important metadata in addition to credentials (e.g. a company ID, tenant ID, instance URL, etc).

To see if Nango stores metadata for a specific API check the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) and look for the `metadata` property.

Nango stores this metadata in the [Connection](/core-concepts#connections) objects. You can retrieve it with the [SDKs](/sdks) or [REST API](/api-reference).

## Configure Integrations programmatically

Nango offers a [REST API](/api-reference/integration/list) to programmatically manage your [Integrations](/core-concepts#integrations).
