## Custom Callback URL

<Warning>
Before saving the custom callback URL in Nango, ensure that:

-   the callback URL redirects to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and passes along all parameters (e.g. 308 redirect)
-   your OAuth app, as registered with the external API provider, has the new callback URL whitelisted

</Warning>

Customize the callback URL in your [Dashboard's project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings). If self-hosting Nango, follow the instructions [here](self-host/instructions).

## Connection configuration

Some API Providers require connection-specific configuration variables (e.g. Zendesk, Shopify, Qualtrics, Contentstack).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is specific to a user's Zendesk account:

```
https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new
```

To specify the subdomain, pass in an additional configuration object to `nango.auth()`:

```javascript
nango.auth('zendesk', '<CONNECTION-ID>', { params: { subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' } });
```

You can find which configuration parameters are necessary for your integration in the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) file.

## Connection metadata

During the OAuth flow, certain APIs return important metadata in addition to credentials (e.g. a company ID, tenant ID, instance URL, etc).

Nango stores this metadata in the Connection objects. You can retrieve it with the [SDKs](/sdks) or [API](/api).

## Configure integrations programmatically

Read the [API reference](/api) to programmatically manage integrations.
