Step 0: Run Nango with the [Quickstart](/quickstart).

## Step 1: Configure a new integration

On the dashboard's `Integrations` tab, click the `Add New` button.

Select an pre-configured integration in the dropdown or [contribute a new one](/contribute).

Fill out your app details and click `Save`.

## Step 2: Get user authorization

On the dashboard's `Integrations` tab, click the `Auth` button for the integration you just configured.

Embed the generated code snippet in your frontend or provide authorization yourself by clicking the `Authorize` button.

## Step 3: Retrieve the API Key

Use our [SDKs](/sdks) and [API](/api) to retrieve the API Key by fetching the relevant Connection, using the same `Connection ID` that you specified in Step 2.

Et voil√† ! This is all it takes to access APIs using API keys, on behalf of users.
