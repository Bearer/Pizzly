description: 'Quickly authorize the Github API & sync Github issues, using Nango.'
---

In this quickstart, we will:
1. Run Nango locally
2. Authorize an API (e.g Github)
3. Sync objects from an API (e.g. Github issues)

<Tip>
    We recommend you install nango globally via the command
    ```bash
    npm install nango -g
    ```
</Tip>

## Step 1: Run Nango locally

Run Nango locally (with Docker):
```bash
nango start
```

Open the Dashboard in your browser ([http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)).

## Step 2: Authorize an API (e.g Github)

### Configure the Github integration in Nango
On the Dashboard, go to the [New Integration page](http://localhost:3003/integration/create). 

Use the value `github` for both the `Integration Provider` dropdown and the `Integration Unique Key` field.

To get the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` you will need to register your app with Github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app). Github will ask you to submit the `Callback URL` shown at the bottom of the New Integration page on Nango. You should also select the `repo` scope both while creating the OAuth app on Github and on the New Integration page on Nango. 

### Test the Github Integration
Click "OAuth" next to the integration to try an OAuth flow from Nango. Keep the default value `test-connection-id` for the `Connection ID` field.

- If you get an error, check the [Activity tab](http://localhost:3003/activity): The logs there can show you helpful information to debug the issue.
- Retrieve your access token from the [Connections tab](http://localhost:3003/connections). 
    
<Tip>
If you are using Nango to authorize APIs, that's it ðŸŽ‰ You can check the [API Authorization guide](/guides/oauth) to find out how to authorize users directly from your frontend and retrieve credentials from your backend.
</Tip>

## Step 3: Sync data from an API (e.g. Github issues)

### Configure a Sync

Kill the console tab when you ran `nango start` in Step 1 (or press `Ctrl` + `c`).

In the folder where you want your integration files (recommendation: root of your project), run:
```
nango dev
```

Answer `yes` when prompted if you want to "create some default integrations and build them". This will create a `nango-integrations` folder with two prefilled files:
- `nango.yaml` contains the **configuration** to sync Github issues
- `github-issue-example.ts` contains the **code** to sync Github issues

The rest of the files are automatically-generated based on the two previous files (e.g. `models.ts`, `dist/*`).

### Test the Sync

Open a new terminal tab, go to folder that contains the `nango-integrations` folder and test your sync by running:

```bash
nango sync:run -p github -s github-issue-example -c test-connection-id
```

This will only execute a dry run of the Sync. Synced objects will not be persisted in Nango's storage. It allows you to quickly check if your Sync script is correct.

### Deploy the Sync

Finally, you can deploy your sync locally:

```bash
nango deploy:local
```

This will automatically start syncing Github issues for the Connection that you created in Step 2, continuously. You can manage your Syncs from the [Dashboard](http://localhost:3003/syncs).

### Retrieve the synced data

Fetch the always-fresh data from the Sync in your backend with the [backend SDK](/sdks) or the [REST API](/api-reference):

```ts Node SDK example
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ host: 'http://localhost:3003' });

const result = await nango.getRecords({
    providerConfigKey: 'github',
    connectionId: 'test-connection-id',
    model: 'GithubIssue'
});
```
