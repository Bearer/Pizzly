# Nango Overview

Nango is the **most powerful product integrations platform** designed for developers at B2B SaaS companies. 

Nango helps you build, manage, and scale integrations with third-party APIs, through a single interface. It is as flexible as building integrations in-house, while taking care of API-specific complexities for you, so you can focus on making integrations your best product feature.

With Nango you get:

**Hundreds of pre-built integrations**
    - Ready-to-use integration templates for 250+ APIs

**Developer tooling pre-configured for each API**
    - Authorization: OAuth, API key, basic, custom
    - Rate-limit handling, pagination and retries
    - Two-way sync infrastructure
    - End-to-end type safety and runtime data validation
    - Real-time webhook infrastructure
    - Observability and alerting: HTTP requests, customer-level reporting, etc
    - Per-customer integration configuration: field mappings, toggle features, etc
    - Tooling to develop, test, deploy, and migrate custom integrations (git-based)
    - API unification with your own schemas
    - UI components to embed in your app

**Comprehensive API documentation**
    - Hundreds of API quirks, gotchas, helpful links, and hard-earned learnings

**Access to API experts**
    - Experts for enterprise APIs (Netsuite, Workday, Salesforce, SAP, etc.)
    - Sandbox accounts
    - Service to build your custom integrations

### How is Nango different from unified APIs and embedded iPaaS? 

Unified APIs and embedded iPaaS tools take a rigid approach, focusing on pre-built use cases that often introduce limitations in the integrations you can build. These solutions aren’t truly built for developers—as your needs grow, you either outgrow them or find yourself working around their constraints.

Nango is built with a different mindset: to unleash integration creativity. Instead of limiting you to pre-defined schemas or workflows, Nango provides best-in-class developer tooling to help you build and customize integrations exactly the way your customers need them. Whether it’s deep customization, polished experiences, or handling the unique quirks of specific APIs, Nango empowers developers to create integrations that stand out.

# Overview of integrating Nango

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get user permission in your app">
    Use the Nango frontend SDK to get the user's permission to access their external data.

    Nango guides the user through the auth flow in a popup window.

    Store the `connectionId` in your database to retrieve the user's data later.

    ```ts Frontend: Trigger the OAuth flow.
    const nango = new Nango({ connectSessionToken });

    // Shows authorization popup to the user.
    await nango.openConnectUI({
        onEvent: (event) {
            if (event.type === 'connect') {
                // The auth flow succeeded. The user is connected!
                saveToDatabase(connectionId, integrationId);
            }
        }
    });
    ```

    <Tip>
    When a new user connects your integration, Nango automatically starts fetching their data (e.g. issues, contacts, files, etc.) in the background.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive data update notifications">
    Nango uses webhooks to notify your backend when external user data has been added, updated or deleted. Nango will only notify you when there are actual changes.

    ```json Backend: Webhook payload with new data
    {
        "connectionId": "user123",
        "providerConfigKey": "zendesk",
        "model": "ticket",
        "responseResults": { "added": 2, "updated": 6, "deleted": 0 },
        "modifiedAfter": "2023-05-31T11:46:13.390Z"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect and save the new data">
    When you receive a Nango webhook, fetch the most recent data from Nango using the backend SDK or API.

    Nango returns the data in the schema of your choice, which can be standardized across different APIs.

    You can directly save this data to your database, or process it further, as needed.

    ```ts Backend: Fetch & save new records.
    const records = await nango.listRecords<Ticket>({
        providerConfigKey: 'zendesk',
        connectionId: 'user123',
        model: 'ticket',
        modifiedAfter: modifiedAfter
    });

    saveToDatabase(records);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write back to external APIs">
    Push updates back to external APIs in a way that is:

    - **Synchronous:** Have your changes immediately reflected.
    - **Unified:** Benefit from standardized schemas across different APIs.
    - **Customizable:** Support intricate workflows and composed API calls.

    ```ts Backend: Write back to external APIs.
    const result = await nango.triggerAction({
        providerConfigKey: 'zendesk',
        connectionId: 'user123',
        action: 'create-ticket',
        input: { "title": "...", "content": "..." }
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize integrations">
    Nango stands out in its ability to let you create custom integrations through code. 
    
    Your custom integration code is deployed and run by Nango, similarly to lambda functions.
