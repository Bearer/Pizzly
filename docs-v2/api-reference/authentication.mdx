title: 'Authentication'

Authentication depends on the environment in which you run Nango.

## Nango Cloud

Simply use the Nango Secret Key available in your [Project Settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) as Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

## Nango Self-Hosted

By default, Nango Self-Hosted does not require to authenticate API requests, which is well-suited for local testing.

If you plan to release Nango Self-Hosted in production, please visit the [self-hosting instructions](/self-host/instructions).

Once you have enabled API authentication, use Basic auth instead of Bearer auth.
