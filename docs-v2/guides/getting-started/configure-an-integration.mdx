# Create an account

# Create an integration

Go to [Integrations](https://app.nango.dev/dev/integrations), click the  _Configure New Integration_ button and select the API to integrate with.

<Tip>
    Each API has a dedicated Nango documentation page with useful links, gotchas, etc.
</Tip>

APIs have different ways to authorize requests: OAuth, API key, Basic, custom. Nango abstracts away the difficulties of working with each one.

<Accordion title="Only for OAuth APIs">
    OAuth APIs require you to register your OAuth application on their developer portal.

    When registering, the API provider will prompt you for the `Callback URL`. Use the one displayed in the Nango integration settings. Remember to register the required scopes in the Nango integration settings and, if necessary, with the API provider.

    Collect your OAuth app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the API portal and input them in your Nango integration settings.
</Accordion>

# Test the authorization

If you don't have one already, create a test account for the external API you want to integrate with.

On the Nango integration page, click "Add Connection" to test the authorization. Enter your test account credentials to authorize the API.

Once authorized, go to [Connections](https://app.nango.dev/dev/connections) to see the newly created connection. The "Authorization" tab contains the credentials necessary to consume the external API. These credentials are securelly stored and automatically refreshed.
