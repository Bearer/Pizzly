Complete the following steps to whitelabel the OAuth flow:

# Use your own OAuth app

You can use your own OAuth app to handle the OAuth flow as described in the [_Configure an integration_ guide](/guides/main/configure-an-integration). This way, the OAuth flow to match your brand and user experience.

# Use a custom callback URL

Some API providers (e.g. Google) show the domain of the callback URL to the user during the OAuth flow. By default, the domain of the callback URL is `api.nango.dev`.

You can whitelabel this experience by using a custom callback URL which uses your domain.

If you are using Nango Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Add a new endpoint in your app, e.g. `https://EXAMPLE.com/oauth-callback`. All requests to this endpoint should redirect to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and **pass along all original parameters**. The easiest way to do this is with a 308 redirect.
2. Change the registered OAuth callback URL with all API providers. Otherwise, they will refuse new flows!
3. When ready, change your Nango callback URL in the _Environment Settings_ tab.

If you are self-hosting Nango, follow the instructions [here](/host/self-host/self-hosting-instructions) to change your callback URL.
