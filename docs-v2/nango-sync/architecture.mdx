## Overview

Nango Sync gives you two ways to work with external APIs:

- **Syncs**: Continuous data syncs where you define how data is synced with the external API
- **Nango Proxy**: Direct API requests to the external API brokered by Nango

You **use syncs for continuous data syncs**: E.g. fetch contacts from Salesforce, GitHub issues, messages from Slack, events from Google Calendar etc.

You **use the Nango Proxy for on-demand actions**: E.g. push a new lead to Salesforce, add comment to a GitHub issue, post a message to Slack, update an event on Google Calendar etc.

In both cases Nango handles auth, token refreshes, retries, rate-limit handling, monitoring etc. for you.

## Continuous data Syncs

Syncs are defined by you and live in your own repository: They are version controlled together with your other code.

We have [examples](/nango-sync/examples) for many popular use cases to help you get started and we have tooling to help you write and test syncs locally (see the [guide on writing syncs]).

When your Syncs are ready you deploy them with a CLI command to the Nango server: Nango then runs them for you in production and handles scaling, scheduling, retries, data caching, de-duplication etc for you.

### `nango-integrations` folder

Syncs have two parts:
- A config file called `nango.yaml`, which defines which syncs exist, how often they should run etc.
- A small typescript file per sync, which defines the logic of the sync

Both of these live in a folder called `nango-integrations` in your own code repository.

```txt nango-integrations structure
<YOUR-REPO>
    |
    nango-integrations
            |
            +- nango.yaml
            +- github-issues.ts
            +- asana-tasks.ts
            ...
```

Our CLI has functions to help you manage this directory, create scaffolds, check the config file etc.

Take a look at the [examples](/nango-sync/examples) section to get a feel for what syncs look like in practice.

We also have a [guide on writing sync scripts](/nango-sync/guides/sync).

### Data models: End-to-end type safety for your syncs

When you define your sync you also specify the data model of the data you are looking to Sync.

This definition also lives in the `nango.yaml` file:

```yaml nango.yaml
models:
    GithubIssue:
        id: string
        owner: string
        repo: string
        issue_number: number
        ...
```


Nango then automatically generates types for you from it: This way you get full type safety in your sync scripts, the backend SDK for data fetching and even runtime checks when a sync runs.

Syncs and data models can be combined at will:
- One Sync can return multiple data models: e.g. `GithubIssue` and `GithubRepo`
- Multiple syncs can return the same data model: e.g. Salesforce and HubSpot both return `Contact`

This lets you easily **create your own unified API** with your own data model.

### Webhooks: Realtime data syncs

Nango supports two kinds of webhooks:
- Webhooks coming in from the external API to Nango: Fetch changed data in realtime
- Webhooks from Nango to your app: Notify your app of changes in realtime

Incoming webhooks can either directly store the new data or trigger a Sync to make additional API requests.

Webhooks from Nango to your app are triggered whenever Nango has new data available for a Sync: Either because a scheduled sync finished or due to a webhook from the external API.

Learn more in the [Webhooks guide](/nango-sync/guides/webhooks)

## Direct API requests with Nango Proxy

Sometimes you want to make a API requests on demand:
- Write data back on demand
- Fetch one-off data that doesn't need to be continuously synced (e.g. for onboarding)

The Nango Proxy makes this easy lets you still benefit from the Nango platform for auth, retries, rate-limit handling etc.

Take a look at the [Nango Proxy guide](/nango-sync/guides/nango-proxy) for examples & more details.

## Dashboard: Monitoring & management of syncs

The [Nango Dashboard](https://app.nango.dev) shows you a detailed activity log of every sync and proxy request.  
You can view detailed logs of every sync run and also log your own messages from Sync scripts.

You can also see and manage the Syncs for each [Connection](/core-concepts#connections).
