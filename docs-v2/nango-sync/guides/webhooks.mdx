## Webhooks from external APIs to Nango[](#to-nango)

Nango can handle incoming webhooks from external APIs for you.

When a webhook is received you can define how it shoudl be handled:
- Map the data from the webhook to one of your defined data models
- Trigger a sync script, so you can make additional API requests to retrieve the new data

## Webhooks from Nango to your app[](#from-nango)

You can configure Nango to send a webhook to your app every time a sync finishes and new data is available.

To set this up go to [project settings](https://app.nango.dev/project-settings) and set your webhook receive URL there.

The webhook from Nango is a POST request with the following body:

```json
{
    "connectionId": "<user-id>";              // The Connection's id, as set by you in nango.auth
    "providerConfigKey": "<integration-id>";  // The name of the integration in Nango, e.g. github
    "syncName": "<sync-name>";                // The name of the sync as defined in nango.yaml, e.g. github-tickets
    "model": "<data-model>";                  // The name of the data model, e.g. ticket
    "responseResults": {
		    "addedKeys": 123;                 // The number of new records
		    "updatedKeys": 123;               // The number of updated records
    };
    "syncType": "INITIAL" | "INCREMENTAL";  
    "queryTimestamp": "2023-05-31T11:46:13.390Z"; // Use this with "delta" in getRecords to fetch the data of this sync
}
```

If your sync returns multiple models you may receive multiple webhooks for the same sync run (one for each model).
