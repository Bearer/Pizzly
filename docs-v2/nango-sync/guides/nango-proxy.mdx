## When to use the Nango Proxy

The **Nango Proxy** makes it faster for you to query external APIs by handling:
* Authentication
* Automatically sets the correct base URL (for some APIs this depends on the user)
* Automatic logging & monitoring
* Rate-limit handling (with automatic retries)
* Configurable retries

It is especially useful for:
* One-off requests to fetch e.g. metadata from the API
* Writing simple data back to the API on demand
* Scripts and quick PoCs

If you want to continuously Sync data from the external API you should use Nango's [continuous data syncs](/nango-sync/sync) instead.

## Using the Nango Proxy

<Note>
    The Nango Proxy is not available for all APIs yet.  
    Check the API's [Integrations page](/integrations) (`Cmd + K` for search) to see if it is available for you API.

    If you need additional APIs supported please reach out on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack): We can enable support within a few hours.
</Note>

To use the Nango Proxy you should have done the [Quickstart](/quickstart) and have at least one [Integration](/core-concepts#integrations) with a [Connection](/core-concepts#connections) setup.

### Proxy requests logging

All requests that run through the Nango Proxy are automatically logged to the Activity Tab in Nango. The logs there can help you debug failing requests.

### Proxy requests with the SDKs

All Nango SDKs support the Nango Proxy and offer convenience functions such as `nango.get({})`, `nango.post({})` etc.

Refer to the [SDK Reference](/sdks) for full details on proxy options.

```typescript
const res = await nango.proxy({
    method: 'POST',
    endpoint: '/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList',
    providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
    retries: 5, // Retries with exponential backoff (optional, default 0)
    data: {
        id: 1,
        colorId: 'blue',
        selected: true
    }
});
```

### Proxy requests with the REST API

You can also use the REST API (cf. [proxy API reference](/api-reference/proxy/get)) to execute proxy requests.

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' \
-H 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>' \
-H 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
-d '{"colorId: "blue"}' \
'https://api.nango.dev/proxy/<API-ENDPOINT>'
```
