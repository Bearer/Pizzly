Sometimes you need to make one-off synchronous requests to the external API. With the **Nango Proxy**, you can do this without having to worry about authentication, logging & monitoring, etc.

Before using Nango Proxy, you need to run Nango (cf. [Quickstart](/quickstart)), then configure an integration with [OAuth](/guides/api-access-with-oauth) or [API Key](<(/guides/api-access-with-key)>).

## With the SDKs

Use our SDKs (cf. [reference](/sdks)) to execute proxy requests, e.g. in Typescript:

```typescript
const res = await nango.proxy({
    method: 'POST',
    endpoint: '/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList',
    providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
    data: {
        id: 1,
        colorId: 'blue',
        selected: true
    }
});
```

## With the REST API

Use our REST API (cf. [reference](/api)) to execute proxy requests, e.g.:

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <NANGO-SECRET-KEY>' \
-H 'Provider-Config-Key: <INTEGRATION-ID>' \
-H 'Connection-Id: <CONNECTION-ID>' \
-d '{"colorId: "blue"}' \
'https://api.nango.dev/proxy/<API-ENDPOINT>'
```
