In this guide, we will sync issues from Github as `tickets`. It entails:

1. Adding a folder in your repo where your [Syncs](/nango-sync/architecture) will live
2. Defining a `ticket` data model & configuring the sync
3. Writing minimal code to fetch issues and transform them into `tickets`

We recommend you read the [Architecture](/nango-sync/architecture) page before this guide.

## 1. Start Nango locally

From your repository's root directory run:

```bash
npx nango dev
```

This will start Nango and automatically recompile your integration files as needed.

## 2. Create your nango-integrations folder

Regardless of your programming language, in your repo, run:

```bash
npx nango init && cd nango-integrations # Your new integrations folder
```

## 3. Configure your Sync

Open the `nango.yaml` config file and define a new `github-tickets` sync and `ticket` model:

```yaml
integrations:
	github:
		github-tickets:
			runs: 'every hour'
			returns:
				- ticket
models:
	ticket:
		id: uuid
		author: string
		author_id: uuid
		...
```

Note that the `id` property is mandatory and is used by Nango to de-duplicate records.

Then run:

```bash
npx nango g # Generates the model & scaffolding
```

## 4. Write your Integration code

Open the `github-tickets.ts` which contains the following template:

```typescript
import { NangoSync } from '@nangohq/node';
import { ticket } from './models';

export default async function fetchData(nango: NangoSync): Promise<{ticket: ticket[]}> {
	// Integration code goes here.
}
```

Fill in the `fetchData` method with your integration code:

```typescript
// API requests: handles auth, retries, rate-limiting, pagination and more.
const ghIssues = nango.get('/NangoHQ/nango/issues');

// Mapping Github issues to tickets.
const tickets: ticket[] = ghIssues.map(issue => ({
    id: issue.id,
    author: issue.user.login,
    author_id: issue.user.id,
    ...
}));

// Return strongly-typed objects.
return { ticket: tickets }
```

Easily test your sync with the CLI:

```bash
npx nango sync:run -p github -s github-tickets -c <user-id>
```

Finally, if all looks good you can deploy your sync to Nango:

```bash
npx nango deploy
```

## 5. Fetch synced data in your backend

Fetch the always-fresh data from the Sync in your backend with the [SDK](/sdks) (or the [REST API](/api-reference)):

```ts Node SDK example for Nango Cloud
import { Nango }  from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<SECRET-KEY>' });

const result = await nango.getRecords({
    providerConfigKey: 'github',
    connectionId: '<user-id>',
    model: 'ticket'
});
```

Nango can also send you [webhook](/nango-sync/webhooks) whenever new data is available from a sync.

That's it!

When a user authorizes your Github integration through `nango.auth()` their issues will start syncing continuously.
