In this guide, we will sync issues from Github as `tickets`. It entails:

1. Adding a folder in your repo where your [Integration](/core-concepts#integrations) code will live
2. Defining a `ticket` data model & configuring the sync
3. Writing minimal code to fetch issues and transform them into `tickets`

## 1. Create your integrations folder

Regardless of your programming language, in your repo, run:

```bash
npx nango init && cd nango-integrations # Your new integrations folder
```

## 2. Configure your Integration

Open the `nango.yaml` config file and define a new `github-tickets` sync and `ticket` model:

```yaml
integrations:
	github-tickets:
		provider: github
		runs: 'every hour'
		returns:
			- ticket
models:
	ticket:
		id: uuid
		author: string
		author_id: uuid
		...
```

Then run:

```bash
npx nango g # Generates the model & scaffolding
```

## 3. Write your Integration code

Open the `github-tickets.ts` which contains the following template:

```typescript
import { NangoSync, NangoHelper } from '@nangohq/node';
import { ticket } from '@nangohq/models';

class GitHubTicketSync extends NangoSync {

async function fetchData(nango: NangoHelper): { [ticket.name]: [ticket.type] } {
	// Integration code goes here.
}

export GitHubSync;
```

Fill in the `fetchData` method with your integration code:

```typescript
// API requests: handles auth, retries, rate-limiting, pagination and more.
const ghIssues = nango.get('/v1/issues', paginated=true);

// Mapping Github issues to tickets.
const tickets = ghIssues.map(issue => {
    ticket.field.id: issue.unique_id,
    ticket.field.author: issue.username,
    ticket.field.author_id: issue.username_id,
    ...
});

// Return strongly-typed objects.
return { [ticket.name]: tickets }
```

Finally, deploy your code to Nango:

```bash
npx nango deploy
```

That's it! When a user authorizes Github with Nango Auth, their issues will sync continuously! Nango provides:

-   An SDK & API to access objects (strongly-typed)
-   A webhook to get real-time updates (strongly-typed)
-   A cache with fresh & highly-available data
-   Built-in tooling for easy API requests (pagination, retries, rate-limit handling, transient errors etc.)
-   Monitoring & Management console
-   Automatic scaling & reliability
