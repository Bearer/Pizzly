## ‚≠ê Nango Sync at a glance

Nango Sync lets you make requests and sync data with external APIs, on behalf of users. It works in isolation and seamlessly integrates with [Nango Auth](/nango-auth).

It supports:

-   bi-directional continuous syncing
-   synchronous/asynchronous reads & writes
-   real-time updates with webhooks
-   rate-limit & retry handling
-   auto-pagination & incremental syncing
-   monitoring & an admin console

## üë©‚Äçüíª How it looks in my code

1-liner to fetch structured objects from any external API:

```js
nango.github().issues('<user-id>');
```

## 100+ pre-configured APIs, easily add your own

Nango works with **any** API and use-case. Adding [Integration Templates](/core-concepts#integration-templates) is easy and we already have the main APIs covered.

100+ APIs are pre-configured to work out-of-the-box, including:

-   **CRM**: Front, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc.
-   **Accounting**: Xero, Sellsy, Zoho Books, etc.
-   **Fintech:** Brex, Stripe, Braintree, Ramp etc.
-   **Developer tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira etc.
-   **Communication**: Gmail, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, Zoom etc.
-   **Productivity**: Asana, Airtable, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Trello,
    GSheet, ClickUp etc.
