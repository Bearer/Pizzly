## Receive webhooks on data updates

Receive webhooks from Nango when new records are available ([step-by-step guide](/integrate/guides/receive-webhooks-from-nango)).

## Keeping track of where you left off

Each record from this endpoint comes with a synchronization cursor in `_nango_metadata.cursor`.

Save the last fetched record's cursor to track how far you've synced.

By providing the cursor to this endpoint, you'll continue syncing from where you left off, receiving only post-cursor changes.

This same cursor is used to paginate through the results of this endpoint.

## Response

By default, this returns an array of records in the data model that you queried, with some metadata about each record.

```json
[
    {
        id: 123,
        ..., // Fields as specified in the model you queried
        _nango_metadata: {
            deleted_at: null,
            last_action: 'ADDED',
            first_seen_at: '2023-09-18T15:20:35.941305+00:00',
            last_modified_at: '2023-09-18T15:20:35.941305+00:00',
            cursor: 'MjAyNC0wMy0wNFQwNjo1OTo1MS40NzE0NDEtMDU6MDB8fDE1Y2NjODA1LTY0ZDUtNDk0MC1hN2UwLTQ1ZmM3MDQ5OTdhMQ=='
        }
    },
    ...
]
```
