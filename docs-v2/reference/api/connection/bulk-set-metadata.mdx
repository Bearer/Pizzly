## Bulk set _connection metadata_

Nango uses the request body as the new metadata (it must be a JSON object). The `connection_ids` must be passed in the body as an array of strings. Note that this overrides any existing metadata.

## Fetching _connection metadata_

To read the existing metadata of a _connection_, simply fetch the connection. Your custom metadata is included as part of the returned connection object.
