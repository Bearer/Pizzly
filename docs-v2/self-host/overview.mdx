## Features you can self-host independently

The following features of Nango have been designed with easy self-hostability in mind, ensuring that you can deploy them independently in your own environment:
- API authorization through [OAuth](/guides/oauth), [API key, or Basic auth](/guides/api-key)
- [Request proxying](/guides/proxy)

<Tip>
These features are widely adopted by many companies in production. They simplify the process of obtaining, storing, and refreshing credentials to access any API. Alternatively, these features are also available without limitations on our [Cloud](/cloud).

## Features requiring Nango's expertise to self-host

The following features can be self-hosted but require our direct intervention, typically catered to Enterprise customers:
- [Syncs](/guides/sync)
- [Actions](/guides/actions)
- [Webhooks](/guides/webhooks)

Given their intricate nature and reliance on complex external dependencies, these features are readily available on our [Cloud](/cloud). For those interested in a self-hosted solution with these features, please reach out on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) to discuss our Enterprise offerings.
