If you find a bug with one of the existing providers feel free to use these
steps to submit a PR with a fix. Thank you!

## Step 0: A quick overview of how provider templates work in Nango

Support for the OAuth flow of different providers in Nango is implemented with
templates: A small config that tells Nango how to perform the OAuth flow for the
specific provider.

All [Integration Templates](/core-concepts#integration-templates) of Nango live in a single file called
[providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml).

Most templates only need to make use of 2-3 configuration keys, but in some
cases you might need more.

The most commonly used configuration options are:

```yaml
provider-slug: # Shorthand for the provider, ideally the provider's name. Must be unique. Kebab case.
    ##########
    # Mandatory fields
    ##########
    auth_mode: OAUTH2 # Either OAUTH1 (for OAuth 1.0a) or OAUTH2
    authorization_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/authorize # The URL of the authorization page for the OAuth service (supports string interpolation)
    token_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/token # The URL for the token request (supports string interpolation)

    ##########
    # Optional fields
    ##########
    authorization_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the authorization step
        response_type: code
    token_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the token request
        mycoolparam: value
    refresh_url: https://api.example.com/oauth/refresh # The URL to use for refreshing the access token (only if different from token_url)
    scope_separator: ',' # String to use to separate scopes. Defaults to ' ' (1 space) if not provided

    # Metadata capture
    redirect_uri_metadata:
        - subdomain # Save the 'subdomain' query parameter value returned in the Redirect URI (Connection Metadata)
    token_response_metadata:
        - scopes # Save the 'scopes' query parameter value returned in the token response (Connection Metadata)
```

<Note>Templates support parameters using string interpolation for dynamic URLs, etc.</Note>

<Note>
    You can configure some [Connection Metadata](/nango-auth/configuration), which is additional metadata that you want to capture during the OAuth flow and
    store in the Connection.
</Note>

## Step 1: Add your new provider to `providers.yaml`

Fork the repo and edit the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) file as explained
above to add support for the new provider. The API documentation should contain
all the details you need on the OAuth flow to complete this step.

[We are here](https://nango.dev/slack) if you need help with this.

## Step 2: Test your new provider

<Tip>
Some OAuth providers are very restrictive with callback URIs and require https
or don't allow `localhost` as a domain/URL. This can make it very hard to test
things locally.

The easiest workaround we found is to use this simple service:
[https://redirectmeto.com](https://redirectmeto.com/).

With this the Nango localhost callback URL becomes
`https://redirectmeto.com/http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback` and you will
need to update the `NANGO_CALLBACK_URL` in the `.env` file:

```bash
NANGO_CALLBACK_URL=https://redirectmeto.com/http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback
```

</Tip>

To test your new provider:

Start the docker containers:

```bash
docker compose up
```

The docker compose configuration in the root of the repo `docker-compose.yaml`
will run 2 containers.

1. Postgres DB
2. Nango Server

To propagate your changes after editing the `providers.yaml` file, run:

```bash
docker compose restart nango-server # Force a restart, which will load in the yaml again
docker compose run nango-server cat packages/shared/providers.yaml # print the contents of the providers file from inside the container
```

When you are ready to test your new provider template:

### 1\. Add your client credentials to the local Nango Server

Open the [local dashboard](http://localhost:3003) in your browser and add a new
[Integration](/core-concepts#integrations) with your freshly added provider (it should show up in the provider
dropdown).

### 2\. Trigger the OAuth Flow

Run an OAuth flow on the
[local dashboard](http://localhost:3003/connection/create).

You can modify the ports in the docker compose if there are any conflicts with
other local services on your host machine.

### 3\. Check the access token in the dashboard

If all goes well you should see your new Connection in the
[Connections list](http://localhost:3003/connections) in the dashboard.

Check the Connection details and make sure all looks as expected (access token,
refresh token, metadata).

## Step 3: Add your integration to the Documentation

Add a file named `<provider_slug>.mdx` (e.g. `github.md`) corresponding to your
new integration to the `docs/integrations/all` folder. You can check out check out
[asana](/integrations/all/asana) for an example.

Also, add your new documentation page to `docs/mint.json` in the `Integrations` group (in alphabetical order).

## Step 4: Submit your PR

Submit your PR with the new provider to the Nango repo. Please thoroughly test
the integration.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!! ❤️
