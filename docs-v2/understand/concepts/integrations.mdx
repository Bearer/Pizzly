# Overview
An Integration within Nango is essentially your product's setup for connecting to an external API on your customers' behalf. It's how you configure Nango to interact with services like GitHub, Slack, or any other external platform that your product needs to integrate with.

# Creating integrations
Creating an integration is straightforward and only takes a few clicks in the Nango UI. Whether for GitHub, Slack, or any other service, you'll set up one integration per service.

Each integration has a unique identifier you can see and edit in the settings on the Nango UI.

# Authorization methods
Integrations define how to authenticate API access. The primary methods include:

- **OAuth:** The most common method, enabling customers to authenticate directly within your app with an embedded sign-in form from the external provider.
- **API key:** Customers provide an API key for your app to access the external service on their behalf.
- **Other methods** include basic authentication and custom methods like GitHub Apps or Stripe Apps.

For OAuth, you'll input the credentials & permissions of the OAuth app you've set up on the external service's developer portal, accessible within the integration's settings in the Nango UI ([step-by-step guide](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api)).

# Configuration details
Beyond authorization, integrations include configurations for how your app uses the external API, such as:

- **API reference**: Found in the "API Reference" tab, this includes information necessary for utilizing external APIs through Nango.
- **Scripts**: Underlying scripts that facilitate Nango's interaction with the external API are listed in the Scripts tab. These [integration scripts](/understand/concepts/scripts) power the endpoints in the API reference, enabling your app to use Nango's unified API without directly dealing with the complexities of external APIs.

# Flexibility and customization
Nango stands out by not limiting you to a fixed set of endpoints & use cases. You can customize or extend the provided templates with your own scripts, allowing you to tailor the integration to your specific needs ([overview](/customize/overview)). This approach will enable you to focus on leveraging a unified API through Nango, streamlining the integration process with external services.
