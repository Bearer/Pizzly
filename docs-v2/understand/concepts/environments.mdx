Nango lets you deploy integrations to multiple cloud environments to ensure that you can develop & test integrations safely, before pushing to production. 

On the Nango UI, you can switch between environments in the left nav bar. 

These environment are shared among team members of your workspace. Edits to environment settings, connections, integrations, scripts, etc. will affect all team members. We are planning to soon add a personal development environment which allows to deploy integrations without affecting team members. In the meantime, you should use the CLI `dryrun` method to test integrations locally (cf. documentation). 

Most of Nango's settings are specific to an environment: 
- Public & secret keys to interact with the Nango API & SDKs
- Callback URL to complete OAuth flows
- Webhook URL to send webhooks form Nango
- Environment variables
- etc.

By default, you get two Nango environments (Dev & Prod) but you can ask us to create more environments for you on the community (cf. community link).

When developing Nango custom integration scripts with the CLI, you should add the secret keys for your various environments to your `.env` file (cf. CLI docs). This will allow you to deploy your integrations to these environments, fetch connection credentials from them for testing, etc.

# Overview

Nango supports multiple cloud environments, enabling safe development and testing of integrations before they go live. This system ensures that your work can move smoothly from development to production.

# Shared workspace environments

All environments within a workspace are shared among team members. Any changes you make—whether to environment settings, connections, integrations, or scripts—will reflect across your team. 

<Info>
We're working on introducing personal development environments to facilitate individual testing and development. Until then, the [dry run feature](/customize/guides/create-a-custom-integration#test-your-scripts-locally) in the CLI is your go-to for local integration testing.
</Info>

Access different environments directly from the Nango UI. The left navigation bar lets you easily switch between them.

# Environment-specific settings

Each environment in Nango comes with its own set of configurations:

- API & SDK Keys: Unique public and secret keys for interacting with the Nango API and SDKs.
- Callback URL: For completing OAuth authentication flows.
- Webhook URL: To receive webhooks from Nango.
- Environment Variables: For custom configuration needs.

These environment-specific settings ensure your integrations can operate under different conditions without conflict.

# Default and additional environments

By default, Nango provides two environments: Development (Dev) and Production (Prod). If your project requires more nuanced staging environments, you're welcome to request additional ones via our community platform.

# Working with the CLI

For developers crafting custom integration scripts, managing your environment's secret keys in a .env file is crucial. This practice allows you to seamlessly deploy integrations across environments and test them with actual connection credentials.
