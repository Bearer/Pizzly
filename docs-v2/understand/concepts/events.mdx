# Scripts
Event-bassed executions are powered by [integration scripts](/understand/concepts/scripts) that encapsulate the logic for interfacing with external APIs. While Nango provides [script templates](understand/concepts/templates) for common use cases, there's also support for custom scripting to meet specific integration needs.

Scripts have the following structure:

```typescript
import type { NangoAction } from '../../models';

export default async function onEvent(nango: NangoAction): Promise<void> {
    // Your integration code goes here.
}
```

The `onEvent` function kicks off when the event the script is associated to is triggered.

Event-based scripts focus solely on immediate tasks without persisting data to Nango's cache, thus calls to `nango.batchSave()`, `nango.batchUpdate()`, and `nango.batchDelete()` are not applicable. However, scripts can call actions, enabling complex workflows through the composition of multiple actions.
