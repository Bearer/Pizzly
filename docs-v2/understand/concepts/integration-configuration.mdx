# The new `nango.yaml` schema

In February 2024, Nango introduced a new schema for the integration configuration (`nango.yaml`). 

This schema has the following benefits: 
- Ability to define custom endpoints for syncs & actions
    - Custom endpoints can be unified across multiple APIs
- Explicitly specify integration specs such as:
    - necessary scopes
    - integration description
    - necessary inputs (parameters for actions, metadata for syncs)
    - outputs (responses for actions, models for syncs)
    - external webhook subscriptions

Nango remains backward compatible with the old schema. But the old schema prevents benefitting from: 
- generated API/SDK specs for sync & action endpoints
- external webhooks
- post-connection scripts
- some improvements to the Nango UI

<Tip>
Migrating to the new `nango.yaml` schema is fast & easy following this [step-by-step guide](/customize/guides/advanced/migrate-integration-configuration).
