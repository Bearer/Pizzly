## Why should I use Nango?

Nango combines the best of two popular options:

-   Building custom integrations in-house (full control, but slow to build & maintenance intense)
-   Buying pre-built integrations (fast, but limited)

It gives you both **full control over the integrations** and it lets you **build production-ready integrations very fast**.

## How does Nango achieve this?

Instead of pre-building entire integrations we pre-built the hard infrastructure.

When you write integrations with Nango, 95% of it is already built for you (see [Introduction](/introduction) for a full features list). All you have to do is write a little bit of code for the logic of your integration:

-   Which data would you like to sync? How should it be transformed?
-   What is the resulting data model?
-   Which data would you like to write back and when?

Based on this Nango generates a fully typed SDK for you and runs your integrations reliably in production. [Learn more here](/nango-sync).

## When should I use Nango?

Nango is a good fit for you if:

-   You want to build integrations fast
-   Pre-built solutions such as embedded iPaaS or unified APIs are too limiting for you
-   You want to minimize maintenance overhead in production

Nango was primarily built for SaaS products where integrations are core to the product experience. If your product (deeply) integrates with other SaaS products Nango is probably a good fit for you.

Nango has not been built for:

-   Automating internal workflows
-   Adding single sign-on login options

## Can I really build any integration with Nango?

Yes you can!

Nango will never restrict which APIs you can work with and what you can do with them.

Currently we support [more than 100 APIs](/integrations/overview) and [adding a new one](/integrations/add-your-own-integration) is quick & easy.

## I am just here for the OAuth

That's also fine. [Nango Auth](/nango-auth) offers pre-built OAuth for 100+ APIs and can be used independently or together with [Nango Sync](/nango-sync).

## I have another question

We wouldd love to help!
