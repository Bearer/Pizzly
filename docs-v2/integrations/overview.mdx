<Note>
Nango is an open-source platform for product integrations. Integrate with external APIs in hours, not weeks, while maintaining full control ([learn more](/introduction)).
</Note>

Nango is pre-configured for 150+ APIs ([full list](/integrations/all/accelo)) and dozens of [integration templates](/understand/concepts/templates) ([full list](/integrations/integration-templates/asana)). 

You can request support for new APIs & templates in the [community](https://nango.dev/slack); we usually deliver them in less than 48 hours.

You can also contribute APIs & integration templates yourself! Here is an [step-by-step guide](/customize/guides/contribute-an-api) for adding APIs, and a [step-by-step guide](/customize/guides/contribute-an-integration-template) for adding templates.
