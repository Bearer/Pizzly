## API gotchas

- OpenAi uses API_KEY auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- Nango supports automatic retries based on the `x-ratelimit-reset-requests` header from OpenAI's API. This header indicates when the request limit will reset, allowing Nango to efficiently manage API calls. Unlike `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`, which pertains to the total token usage,`x-ratelimit-reset-requests` specifically addresses the number of API requests.
