## Connection configuration in Nango

Wildix PBX requires a PBX specific subdomain to run OAuth `demo-pbx`.wildixin.com

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('wildix-pbx', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<pbx-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
