## API gotchas
- E-conomic in Nango uses `Basic` auth mode to access different endpoints. Provide your `YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN` as the Username value and `YOUR_AGREEMENT_GRANT_TOKEN` as the Password value.
- After creating a connection, you can use the Basic credentials as follows;
```js
const connection = await nango.getConnection();
let headers: { [key: string]: string } = {};
if ('username' in connection.credentials && 'password' in connection.credentials) {
    headers = {
        'X-AppSecretToken': connection.credentials.username,
        'X-AgreementGrantToken': connection.credentials.password
    };
} else {
    throw new nango.ActionError({
        message: `Basic API credentials are incomplete`
    });
}

const resp = await nango.get({
    endpoint: '/customers',
    headers: headers
});

```
- E-conomic enforces a rate limit of 50,000 API calls per 24 hour period per agreement. For more details check E-conomic [fair use policy](https://www.e-conomic.com/developer/fair-use-policy)
