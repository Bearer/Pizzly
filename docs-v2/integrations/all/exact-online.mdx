## Useful links

-   Register your app on the [Dev Portal](https://apps.exactonline.com/)
-   Nango implements the [Auth Web APIs mentioned here](https://support.exactonline.com/community/s/knowledge-base#All-All-DNO-Content-gettingstarted) (specifically, it implements the `authorization code` flow).

## Connection configuration in Nango

Exact online uses different domain extensions for different regions.

You need to pass the domain extension to use to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('exact-online', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {extension: 'com'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   Access Token refreshes are only possible in the last 30 seconds of the last one being valid, or of course when there is no valid Access Token anymore.
-   Access Tokens stay valid for only 10 minutes.
