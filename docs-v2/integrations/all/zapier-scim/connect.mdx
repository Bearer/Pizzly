# Overview

To authenticate with Zapier, you need two key pieces of information:
1. **Client ID** - Your Zapier Client ID
2. **Client Secret** - Your Zapier Client Secret


This guide will walk you through finding or creating those credentials within Zapier. 


#### Step 1: Configure a Redirect URI
1. You can configure one (or multiple) redirect URIs in the [Zapier Developer Platform](https://developer.zapier.com/) under **Embed →  Settings → Redirect**. Add Nango's callback URL (https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback)
