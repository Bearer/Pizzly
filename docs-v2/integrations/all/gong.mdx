## Useful links

Gong offers both Basic auth (API key) and OAuth as authentication. Nango implements both. To register an OAuth app, you need to request a developer account. At first, the OAuth app will be private (only for test) and you need an additional approval to make it public.

## API gotchas

- End users can generate API keys [on the Gong API page](https://app.gong.io/company/api). They must have the "technical administrator" user role to do this.
- Gong uses BASIC auth for their API, but doesn't call them username and password: `Access Key` is the username in Nango and `Access Key Secret` is the password in Nango.
- [Gong rate-limits](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#overview) are per second and a total of 10k requests a day.
- Gong-oauth uses `api_base_url_for_customer`, which varies for each customer, as its `base_url` for proxy requests. This parameter is returned in the response of `generate-customer-token`.
