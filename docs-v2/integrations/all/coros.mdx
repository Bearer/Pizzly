## API gotchas
- The Coros API documentation is private, so use the Register Application link above to get access, and the Coros team will share them with you.
- Coros does not list any Oauth scopes in their documentation.
- The Coros sandbox is their test environment set up for developers. Set up separate Nango integrations for the sandbox and production accounts.
