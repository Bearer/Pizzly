## API gotchas
- You need to be on the Hypergrowth plan (or above) to be able to access the API key.
- Instantly in Nango uses the `API_KEY` authentication mode to access different endpoints. The `api_key` is used differently depending on the endpoint. For GET, PATCH and DELETE requests, it is appended to the query parameters, while for some POST requests, it is included in the request body. To clarify this please check on the corresponding Instantly docs pages.
- After creating a connection, you can use the `api_key` as follows;
```js
    const connection = await nango.getConnection();

    let api_key: string;
    if ('apiKey' in connection.credentials) {
        api_key = connection.credentials.apiKey;
    } else {
        throw new nango.ActionError({
            message: `API key credentials is incomplete`
        });
    }

    const postData = {
        api_key: api_key,
        campaign_id: input.campaign_id,
        name: input.name
    };

    const resp = await nango.post({
        endpoint: `/v1/campaign/set/name`,
        data: postData
    });
```
- You can have a look at the following simple [action template](/integrations/integration-templates/instantly) based on [Instantly Set campaign name action](https://app.theneo.io/instantly-ai/instantlyapidocs/campaign-1/set-campaign-name)
- Instantly enforces a general rate limit of 10 requests per second. For more details check [Instantly rate limits](https://app.theneo.io/instantly-ai/instantlyapidocs/introduction/rate-limits)
