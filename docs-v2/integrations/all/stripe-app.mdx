## Connection configuration in Nango

Stripe requires you to use either the application domain or a temporary id (in test mode) to identify your application. See the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#install-app) for more information.

You should add your app domain to the `appDomain` field in the connection params.

```js
nango.auth('stripe-app', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {appDomain: '<stripe-app-domain>'}});
```
