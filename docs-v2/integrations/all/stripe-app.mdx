## Connection configuration in Nango for external test apps

- If you are using the "External Test" version of your app, Stripe requires you to use a temporary id to identify your application. See the [docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#install-app) for more information.

- In this case, you must use the `stripe-app-sandbox` integration in Nango, and add the temporary ID to the `appDomain` field in the connection params.

```js
nango.auth('stripe-app-sandbox', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {appDomain: '<stripe-app-domain>'}});
```

## API gotchas

- Stripe app does not return an `expire_at` or `expire_in` value during the exchange of a code for an access token. However, according to the [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/api-authentication/oauth#refresh-access-token), access tokens expire in one hour, while refresh tokens expire in one year
