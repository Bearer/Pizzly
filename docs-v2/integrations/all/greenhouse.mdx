## Getting started
Greenhouse offers both `Basic` and `OAuth` as authentication and Nango implements both.

## API gotchas

- For `Basic` auth pass Greenhouse API token as username and the password should be blank.
- If you need to use the proxy, it is important to provide the resource that you will be calling in the config (as green house has many forms for API resource). Please see [here](https://developers.greenhouse.io/) for different types of resources. Once confirmed, you have to add `resource` as a config.
