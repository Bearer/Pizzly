## API gotchas

- Braze uses the API_KEY auth_mode with `Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` as a request header to access different endpoints.
- Braze enforces a default rate limit of 250,000 requests per hour. However, certain request types have their own rate limit applied to better handle high volumes of data across their customer base. For details, refer to [API rate limits](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/api_limits/)
