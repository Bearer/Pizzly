## API gotchas

- Pendo uses `API_KEY` auth mode where `x-pendo-integration-key`: `API key` is passed to the request header for Authentication.
- The main URL used to access the Pendo API corresponds to the region and web address you use when logging into Pendo's UI. The baseUrl is set to `https://app.pendo.io` but you can override it using `baseUrlOverride`.
