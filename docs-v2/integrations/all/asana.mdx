## API gotchas

-   If you are getting `The required parameter client_id is missing or invalid`, you will most likely need to go to Developer Console -> Your app -> Manage distribution -> Change from "Specific workspaces" to "Any workspace"
-   In order to use `asana-scim` you need to generate a [service account](https://developers.asana.com/docs/authentication#service-account) in Asana
