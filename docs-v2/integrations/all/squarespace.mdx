## API gotchas

-   Squarespace enforces different rate limits for different endpoints with a cool down period of one minute. For more details check [squarespace rate limits](https://developers.squarespace.com/commerce-apis/rate-limits)
-   Different APIs have different versions. Please confirm the latest version and append it to your resource endpoint, i.e `/{api-version}/commerce/inventory`
-   When creating a connection, you need to add the `customappDescription` configuration parameter, which will be appended to the request as a header: `User-Agent: YOUR_CUSTOM_APP_DESCRIPTION`. Requests without a valid `User-Agent` header are rejected.
