# Overview

To authenticate with Front, you will need your client credentials, which are:
1. **Client ID** - A unique identifier for your client.
2. **Client Secret** - A confidential key used to authenticate the identity of the application (client).

This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining these credentials within Front.

### Prerequisites:

- You must have a registered account with Front.

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Generating your API client credentials
1. Head to the [Developer's Page](https://app.frontapp.com/settings/developers) and click on **Create app**.

2. A form will be presented to you, in here please fill out your application's name and description.
3. Once you submit this form, an application will be created for you. You will then need to enable OAuth in the **OAuth** tab.

#### Step 2: Enter credentials in the Connect UI

After obtaining both the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:
1. Open the form where you need to authenticate with Front within Nango.
2. Enter the **Client ID** in the designated field.
3. Enter the **Client Secret** in the Client Secret field. You can leave the **scopes** blank, as Front does not currently support scoped access tokens.
