# BrightCrowd API Integration

This page provides information about the BrightCrowd API integration in Nango.

## API Description

BrightCrowd is a platform designed to make connections effortless, effective, and enduring. It offers a unique approach to digital engagement, focusing on purposeful connections without the typical features of social networks like liking, commenting, or friending. BrightCrowd is used by higher education institutions, corporations, and non-profits for various purposes such as new student welcome, alumni reunions, new hire onboarding, and industry conferences.

This integration allows you to interact with BrightCrowd's data, including books (which are collections of user profiles) and their members.
