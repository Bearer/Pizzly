## API gotchas

-   BrightCrowd API handles two main resources, `Book` and `Page`.
-   Different auth scopes are required for different requests. To find the exact scope needed for a specific request, please refer to the Security Scopes section, such as the [Request](https://brightcrowd.com/partner-api#/operations/listBooks#Request) for listing all books in the account.

<Note>Add Getting Started links and Gotchas by [editing this page](https://github.com/nangohq/nango/tree/master/docs-v2/integrations/all/brightcrowd.mdx)</Note>
