## API gotchas

- Beehiiv uses `API_KEY` auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer ${apiKey}` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- When creating a new connection in Nango, please add your `publicationId` which will be used to identify your publication when youâ€™re using Beehiiv API, you can obtain this within the API page.

<Note>Add Getting Started links and Gotchas by [editing this page](https://github.com/nangohq/nango/tree/master/docs-v2/integrations/all/beehiiv.mdx)</Note>
