## API gotchas

-   The OAuth1 and OAuth2 APIs give access to different data. Both are supported by Nango.
-   For the OAuth 2 API: To get your `client_id` and `client_secret` you need to generate a "user authentication" within your app in the Twitter development portal.
-   Twitter also offers a client credentials token that authorizes as app instead of a user. This is listed under `twitter-oauth2-cc`. For more details check [twitter client credentials flow](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0/application-only)
