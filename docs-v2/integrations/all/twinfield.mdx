## API gotchas

-   During the OAuth flow, the user can decide to which resources (Bases) the app should have access to. [Read more here](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/oauth-reference#resources)
-   Refresh tokens also expire after 60 days of non use. Make sure you call `nango.getConnection()` at least every 60 days to trigger a refresh.
-   When creating a new connection on Nango, please provide your `cluster`, which determines the specific Twinfield environment (e.g., `accounting`, `accounting2`, or other Twinfield services).
