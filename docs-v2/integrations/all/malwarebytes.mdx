## API gotchas
-   To obtain a client ID/client secret pair, open the Nebula console, go to Settings -> APIs & Integrations. On that page, click the `Add` button and submit the form. Use the resulting client ID/client secret pair, when adding a new connection on Nango.
-   Different authentication scopes are required for various operations within Malwarebytes. To understand the specific scope needed for each API request, please refer to the authentication section of the respective operation in the documentation.
