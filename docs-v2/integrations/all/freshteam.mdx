## API gotchas

- Freshteam is not currently available for new customers, but support is still provided for existing customers.
- Freshteam uses API_KEY auth mode with `authorization: Bearer API_KEY` as a request header to access different endpoints.
- When creating a connection, you need to add the `accountName` as a connection configuration parameter.
- Freshteam enforces a rate limit per minute based on the organization's plan and the number of subscribed employees, applying to the account regardless of the originating IP address. For more details check [Freshteam rate limit](https://developers.freshteam.com/api/#ratelimit)
