## API gotchas

-   If the scope permissions are changed in your app, your users must re-authenticate to ensure that they have explicitly granted your application all of the permissions that it is requesting on their behalf.
-   The scopes available to your app depend on which Products or Partner Programs your app has access to.
-   In order to receive refresh tokens for your connections you must request the "Advertising API" product in your app under the "Products" tab on LinkedIn. This also requires your app to be verified which can be done by your LinkedIn page admin.
