## API gotchas

-   Tokens generated via OAuth have an expiration of 10 years, after which the user will need to reauthenticate the app.
-   If you want to access your own account, you can create an API key from the settings area inside of ThriveCart, and use this to authenticate your APIs.
-   ThriveCart enforces a general rate limit of 60 requests per minute for each account that is connected to the service.
