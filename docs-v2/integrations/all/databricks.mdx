## API gotchas

-   Databricks provides authentication at both the workspace and account levels.
-   For the account level, the `accountId` can be obtained by clicking on the down arrow next to your username in the upper-right corner.
-   For the workspace level, `databricksInstance` refers to the workspace URL of your Databricks deployment. For more details, please visit [Get identifiers for workspace objects](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-url)
