## API gotchas

-   By default, access tokens expire (and cannot be refreshed). To get an access token that does not expire, pass the `no_expiry` scope (along with your other scopes).
-   Read the [usage notes here](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/authentication#usage): You need to pass an additional `key` parameter together with your access token to benefit from higher API quotas.
