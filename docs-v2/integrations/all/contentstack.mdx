## Connection configuration in Nango

Contentstack requires a [region specific subdomain extension](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/developer-hub/contentstack-oauth/#construct-your-authorization-url) to run OAuth. The region depends on where your user's data is hosted with Contentstack.

You also need your app's UID, which you should get from Contentstack after registering.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('contentstack', '<CONNECTION-ID>',
            {
                params: {
                    subdomain: 'app',
                    appId: '<app-uid>'
                }
            });
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
