## API gotchas

- Emarsys offers different APIs(Emarsys core, Loyalty V4 and SMS), currently Nango support Emarsys core API which offers WSSE over SSL authentication.
- When creating a new connection in Nango, use a combination of the `username` and `secret` that you received during onboarding. The `username` follows the format `account_name00X`, where X is a digit.
