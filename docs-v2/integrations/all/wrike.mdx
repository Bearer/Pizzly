## API gotchas

-   Wrike enforces a rate limit of 400 requests per minute. For more information, checkout [wrike API rate limits](https://developers.wrike.com/faq/#:~:text=Our%20current%20rate,Center%20Request).
-   You can find scopes required for each API method in their corresponding method section.
-   Currently, Nango supports the latest version, V4, which allows access to data from only one account at a time. For more information, checkout [wrike migration from V3](https://developers.wrike.com/migration-from-api-v3/)
