## API gotchas

-   There does not seem to be any approval process, and you can immediately use your app.
-   During the authorization flow, users need to manually select which scopes they grant to your application (from the ones you requested). They can complete the flow without granting all the requested scopes. The raw token response (which you can get from the Nango backend SDK) contains the `scope` key that lists the granted scopes.
