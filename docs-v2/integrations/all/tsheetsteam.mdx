## API gotchas
-   TSheetsTeam currently doesn't support scopes.
-   TSheetsTeam enforces a rate limit of 300 calls within any 5 minute time window. Rate limiting is primarily considered on a per-connection basis (per access token). For more details [TSheetsTeam request throttling](https://tsheetsteam.github.io/api_docs/#request-throttling)
