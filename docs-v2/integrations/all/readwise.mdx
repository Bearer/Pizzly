### Reader API (v3)
- The API supports saving new documents to Reader and fetching your documents
- When creating documents:
  - The `url` parameter is required but can be a made-up value if you don't have a real URL
  - If `html` is not provided, the API will attempt to scrape the provided URL
  - The `should_clean_html` parameter (when `html` is provided) will auto-clean HTML and parse metadata
  - Document locations can be: new, later, archive or feed
  - Categories can be: article, email, rss, highlight, note, pdf, epub, tweet or video

### Common
