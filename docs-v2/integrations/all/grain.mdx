## API gotchas

- Grain offers both OAuth and API_KEY authentication modes. For the API_KEY auth mode, `Authorization: Bearer apiKey` is passed in the request header to access different endpoints, where `apiKey` is your account's personal access token.
- The Grain Public API is still in beta. Developer access is limited to select partners. Please reach out to Grain's support for more questions.
