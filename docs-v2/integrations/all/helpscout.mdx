## Getting started
Each user has a Help Scout Docs API key, which is used to authenticate the Docs API. For the Mailbox API, OAuth2 authentication is required.

## API gotchas

- For Help Scout Docs Basic Auth, you will need to pass your `API key` as the username and a dummy password like `X` as the password. Each API key is associated with a Help Scout user.
- For Help Scout Mailbox, access tokens expires after every 172800 seconds which is equivalent to 2 days, you can use `nango.getConnection()` to generate a new set of tokens.
