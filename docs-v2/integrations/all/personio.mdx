## API gotchas

-   Personio offers a separate recruiting API that is API key based and is listed under `personio-recruiting`
-   The values for the Partner-ID Personio-App can be defined by you, but should represent your company name and application name. For example `MY_APPLICATION`, `ACME` are valid values.
