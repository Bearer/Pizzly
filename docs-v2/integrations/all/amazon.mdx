## Connection configuration in Nango

Amazon uses different domain extensions for different regions. E.g. `amazon.com` for the US, `amazon.co.uk` for the UK, or `amazon.de` for Germany.

You need to pass the domain extension to use to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('amazon', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {extension: 'co.uk'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   To refresh the token, simply use `nango.getConnection()` to generate a new set of tokens.
