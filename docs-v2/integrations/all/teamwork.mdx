## API gotchas

-   There are no scopes needed in the authorization, hence, you can keep the scope field empty.
-   Teamwork uses [different domain extensions](https://apidocs.teamwork.com/docs/teamwork/df5a63302d729-getting-started-with-the-teamwork-com-api#getting-your-url) for different regions, i.e `eu` for EU Hosted Customers. For US based clients leave `extension` blank but for EU based customers add `.eu` as your `extension`.
-   Also, provide your `yourSiteName` as your connection `subdomain`. If you're using a custom domain, you can override the set `base_url` using `baseUrlOverride`.
