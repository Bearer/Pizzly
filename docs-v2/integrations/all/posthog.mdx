## API gotchas

- Posthog uses `API_KEY` auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer api_key` as a request header to access different private endpoints.
- Posthog uses different domain extensions codes for different regions, i.e `us` for US cloud, `eu` for EU cloud, and your self-hosted domain for self-hosted instances.
- Posthog enforces different rate limits for different resources. For more details check [posthog rate limits](https://posthog.com/docs/api#rate-limiting)
