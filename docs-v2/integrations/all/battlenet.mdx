## Connection configuration in Nango

- Battlenet uses different domain extensions for different regions.

- You need to pass the domain extension to use to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('battlenet', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {extension: 'com.cn'}});
```

- For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

- When creating a new connection, please provide your `apiDomain`. The API domain for Battle.net varies by `region`. For regions outside of China, the domain follows the format `{region}.api.blizzard.com`, where `{region}` can be `us`, `eu`, `kr`, or `tw`. For China, the API domain is `gateway.battlenet.com.cn`.
## API gotchas

-   Tokens cannot be refreshed, hence when the token expires, resource owners will have to go through the authorize flow again.
