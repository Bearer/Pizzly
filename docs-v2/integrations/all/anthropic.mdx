## API gotchas

- Anthropic uses API_KEY auth mode with `x-api-key: API_KEY` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- When creating a new connection in Nango, you will also need to specify the API version, which can be found under [Anthropic versions](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/versioning)
