## API gotchas

-   This OAuth flow seems to cover the APIs listed [on this page](https://developer.yahoo.com/api).
-   Please provide the `apiBaseUrl`, when creating a new connection on Nango, this can be `fantasysports.yahooapis.com`, for the [Fantacy Sports API](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/) or `api.login.yahoo.com` for the [sign in with Yahoo](https://developer.yahoo.com/sign-in-with-yahoo/#overview) API.
