## API gotchas

- Fireflies uses `API_KEY` auth mode with `Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` as a request header to access different endpoints.
- Fireflies enforces both rate and upload limits for its endpoints based on the subscription plan. For more details check [Fireflies limits](https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/limits)
