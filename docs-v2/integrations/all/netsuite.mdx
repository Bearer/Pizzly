## Connection configuration in Nango

Netsuite requires a user specific account id to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('netsuite', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {accountId: '<netsuite-account-id>'}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- There doesn't seem to be a way to create a Netsuite account without scheduling a call.
