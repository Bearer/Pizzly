## Connection configuration in Nango

Qualtrics requires a user specific subdomain to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('qualtrics', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<qualtrics-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

-   You are required to pass in the Data Center used to register your Qualtrics account as a subdomain for both the OAuth requests and subsequent API requests (cf. [Connection configuration](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization)).
