## Useful links

Chargebee provides REST APIs and webhook to interact with their data. Only the REST APIs is currently supported.
[API docs](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/)

## Connection configuration in Nango

Chargebee requires a user specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('chargebee', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<chargebee-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).

## API gotchas

- Chargebee uses `Basic` auth to access different endpoints. Provide your `API key` as the Username value and leave the password field empty.
- Rate limiting: APIs are rate limited in both test and live sites. Upon breaching the rate limit APIs respond with `429` [docs here](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/error-handling?prod_cat_ver=2#api_rate_limits).
    - Test sites: ~750 API calls per every 5 minutes
    - Live sites: ~150 API calls per site per minute
