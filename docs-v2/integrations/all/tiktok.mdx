## API gotchas

-   The TikTok "App Id" is _not_ the `client_id`. TikTok calls the `client_id` the `Client key` and you should pass this value to Nango as the `client_id`.
-   Make sure you pre-register your scopes in your app's config, otherwise the flow will fail when you ask for them.

<Note>Add Getting Started links and Gotchas by [editing this page](https://github.com/nangohq/nango/tree/master/docs-v2/integrations/all/tiktok.mdx)</Note>
