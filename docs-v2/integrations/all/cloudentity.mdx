## API gotchas
- After creating a new application, a token URL is generated with the necessary Nango connectionConfig parameters in the following order: `https://${connectionConfig.tenantID}.${connectionConfig.regionID}.authz.cloudentity.io/{connectionConfig.tenantID}/${connectionConfig.workspaceID}/oauth2/token`. You will need to add these when creating a new connection.
