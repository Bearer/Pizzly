## Useful links

Workday provides two APIs, a REST and a SOAP one. Only the SOAP is currently supported.

## Connection configuration in Nango

Workday requires a user specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('workday', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<workday-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
