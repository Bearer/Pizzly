## API gotchas

- CodeClimate uses API_KEY auth mode with `Authorization: Token token=token` in the request header to access different endpoints.
- When creating a new connection on Nango, you will need to add your domain. For the cloud option, use `api.codeclimate.com`; for on-premise, use `YOUR-CC-HOST-NAME`.
- CodeClimate enforces a general rate limit of 5,000 requests per token per hour.
