## API gotchas

- QuickBooks requires a company ID/realmId for each API request. To obtain this when creating a new connection on Nango, go to Settings and select Your Account and Settings. On the Your Account page, your Company ID (found under the Billing & Subscription tab) will be displayed at the top.
- You can use [getConnection](/reference/scripts#get-the-connection-credentials) in your integration scripts to retrieve it, or when you fetch the Connection credentials with the REST API or SDK
