## API gotchas

- Use the `docusign-sandbox` configuration in Nango to test your integration with the [Docusign Developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/account/).
- Note that the `integration key` in docusign is the `client id`. Additionally when creating your app, you need to add a secret key.
