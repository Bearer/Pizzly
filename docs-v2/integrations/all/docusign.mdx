## API gotchas

- Use the `docusign-sandbox` configuration in Nango to test your integration with the [Docusign Developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/account/).
- Remember, the DocuSign `integration key` is actually the 'client ID'. Also, you'll need to add a 'secret key' when creating your app.
