## API gotchas

- The Notion OAuth API doesn't support refreshing tokens, and so doesn't return a refresh token. The access token never expires.
- Your Notion OAuth app will have the status "internal". You need to [make it "public"](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization#how-to-make-an-integration-public) to be able to initiate an OAuth flow. Only then, you will be able to get the OAuth client ID/secret and register your callback URL.
- No OAuth scope is required by default.
- Notion SCIM is an enterprise only API that uses an API token. See the Notion [docs](https://www.notion.so/help/provision-users-and-groups-with-scim) for more information
