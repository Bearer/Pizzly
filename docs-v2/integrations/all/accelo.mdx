## Connection configuration in Nango

Accelo [requires a user specific subdomain](https://api.accelo.com/docs/#oauth2-0-uri) to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Nango in the `nango.auth()` call:

```js
nango.auth('accelo', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {params: {subdomain: '<accelo-subdomain>'}});
```

For more details, see the [docs here](/guides/getting-started/authorize-an-api-from-your-app#apis-requiring-connection-specific-configuration-for-authorization).
