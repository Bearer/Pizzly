## API gotchas

-   Google Analytics offers two main categories of APIs: the Admin API, used for managing properties within Google Analytics, and the Data API, which provides access to report data.
-   To access the appropriate authorization scopes for each method, please refer to the Authorization Scopes section for the specific method. For example, see [Authorization scopes](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/rest/v1alpha/properties.audienceLists/get#authorization-scopes) for the Audience List method.
-   While setting up the OAuth app, use the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics` scope for extended capabilities.
-   To enable `Google Analytics` in the developer console for your project, please use the following link: https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=analytics.googleapis.com
