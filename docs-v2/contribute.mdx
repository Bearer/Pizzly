## How API Configurations work in Nango

Contributing a new API Configuration means Nango users will be able to build integrations for this API.

The only required part of the configuration is related to authentication. The rest is optional and optimizes the developer experience of building integrations for this API (e.g. Proxy default base URL, pagination helper, rate-limit helper).

API Configurations take the form of short YAML entries, living in a single file called [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml). Most API Configurations only need to make use of 2-3 configuration keys, but in some cases you might need more.

## API Configuration options

```yaml
provider-slug: # Shorthand for the provider, ideally the provider's name. Must be unique. Kebab case.
    ##########
    # Mandatory fields
    ##########
    auth_mode: OAUTH2 # Either OAUTH1 (for OAuth 1.0a) or OAUTH2
    authorization_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/authorize # The URL of the authorization page for the OAuth service (supports string interpolation)
    token_url: https://${connectionConfig.params.subdomain}.gitlab.com/oauth/token # The URL for the token request (supports string interpolation)

    ##########
    # Optional fields
    ##########
    authorization_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the authorization step
        response_type: code
    token_params: # Additional parameters to pass along in the token request
        mycoolparam: value
    refresh_url: https://api.example.com/oauth/refresh # The URL to use for refreshing the access token (only if different from token_url)
    scope_separator: ',' # String to use to separate scopes. Defaults to ' ' (1 space) if not provided

    # Metadata capture
    redirect_uri_metadata:
        - subdomain # Save the 'subdomain' query parameter value returned in the Redirect URI (Connection Metadata)
    token_response_metadata:
        - scopes # Save the 'scopes' query parameter value returned in the token response (Connection Metadata)
```

<Note>API Configurations support parameters using string interpolation for dynamic URLs, etc.</Note>

<Note>
    You can configure some [Connection Metadata](/nango-auth/configuration), which is additional metadata that you want to capture during the OAuth flow and
    store in the Connection.
</Note>

## Step-by-step guide to add an API Configuration

### Step 1: Add your new provider to `providers.yaml`

Fork the repo and edit the [providers.yaml](https://nango.dev/providers.yaml) file as explained
above to add support for the new API.

### Step 2: Test your new provider

<Tip>
Some APIs require `https` or forbid `localhost` in the callback URL, which makes local development harder. A workaround is to use [https://redirectmeto.com](https://redirectmeto.com/). In this case, edit the `.env` file with your new (local) callback URL:
```bash
NANGO_CALLBACK_URL=https://redirectmeto.com/http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback
```
</Tip>

To test your new provider, go to the `nango` folder root and run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

When you are ready to test your new API Configuration:

**Add your client credentials to the local Nango Server**

Open the [local Dashboard](http://localhost:3003) in your browser and add a new
[Integration](/core-concepts#integrations) with your freshly added provider (it should show up in the provider
dropdown).

**Trigger the OAuth Flow**

Run an OAuth flow on the
[local Dashboard](http://localhost:3003/connection/create).

You can modify the ports in the docker compose if there are any conflicts with
other local services on your host machine.

**Check the access token in the dashboard**

If all goes well you should see your new Connection in the
[Connections tab](http://localhost:3003/connections) in the dashboard.

Check the Connection details and make sure all looks as expected (access token,
refresh token, metadata).

### Step 3: Add your integration to the Documentation

Add a file named `<provider_slug>.mdx` (e.g. `github.md`) corresponding to your
new integration to the `docs/integrations/all` folder. You can check out check out
[asana](/integrations/all/asana) for an example.

Also, add your new documentation page to `docs/mint.json` in the `Integrations` group (in alphabetical order).

### Step 4: Submit your PR

Submit your PR with the new provider to the Nango repo. Please thoroughly test
the integration.

Thanks a lot for your contribution!! ❤️
