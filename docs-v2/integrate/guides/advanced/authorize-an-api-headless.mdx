# Authorize users from your app using headless frontend

<Tip>
It's recommended to use <a href="/integrate/guides/authorize-an-api">Nango Connect</a>, but you can build your own UI using the following API
</Tip>

## Integrate the frontend SDK

Once you have tested that the authorization flow works for your own external account, you can trigger authorization flows for your customers from your app with the Nango SDK.

Get your `Public Key` from the _Environment Settings_ tab.

In your frontend, initiate Nango ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#instantiate-the-frontend-sdk)):

```ts
import Nango from '@nangohq/frontend';

let nango = new Nango({ publicKey: '<PUBLIC-KEY>' });
```

Initiate the authorization flow ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#collect-and-store-end-user-credentials)):

<Tabs>

<Tab title="OAuth">

For OAuth, the `nango.auth()` method will trigger the OAuth flow in a popup, to let the user log in to their external account.

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>')
    .then((result) => {
        // Show success UI.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Show failure UI.
    });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="API Key">

For API keys, the `nango.auth()` method is used to store the end-user's API key (that you have previously collected from them).

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', {
        credentials: {
            apiKey: '<END-USER-API-KEY>'
        }
    })
    .then((result) => {
        // Show success UI.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Show failure UI.
    });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Basic Auth">

For Basic Auth, the `nango.auth()` method is used to store the end-user's username & password (that you have previously collected from them).

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', {
        credentials: {
            username: '<END-USER-API-KEY>',
            password: '<END-USER-PASSWORD>'
        }
    })
    .then((result) => {
        // Show success UI.
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Show failure UI.
    });
```
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Tip>
Nango will automatically collect, store, and refresh the API credentials as needed.

<Info>
Before using Nango in production, we advise [securing the frontend SDK](/integrate/guides/advanced/secure-frontend-sdk).

## APIs requiring connection-specific configuration for authorization

Some APIs require connection-specific configuration (e.g. Zendesk, Shopify).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is specific to a user's Zendesk account:

`https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new`

For these cases, you must provide this configuration when calling `nango.auth()` ([reference](/reference/sdks/frontend#collect-and-store-end-user-credentials)):

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', {
    params: { subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' }
});
```

In some cases you might want to override the scopes provided by an integration at the connection level. For this case you can pass in the scopes to `nango.auth`:

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', {
    params: { oauth_scopes_override: 'custom-connection-scope' }
});
```

This _connection configuration_ is stored in the connection. You can retrieve it with the SDK ([reference](/reference/sdks/node#get-a-connection-with-credentials)), API ([reference](/reference/api/connection/get)), and the Nango UI.

# Troubleshoot authorization errors

If an authorization request fails, you can analyze the relevant log in the _Logs_ tab of the Nango UI.

# Use a custom callback URL

You can personalize Nango's callback URL (e.g. use your domain). If you are using Nango Cloud, follow these steps:

1. Add a new endpoint in your app, e.g. `https://EXAMPLE.com/oauth-callback`. All requests to this endpoint should redirect to `https://api.nango.dev/oauth/callback` and **pass along all original parameters**. The easiest way to do this is with a 308 redirect.
2. Change the registered OAuth callback URL with all API providers. Otherwise, they will refuse new flows!
3. When ready, change your Nango callback URL in the _Environment Settings_ tab.

If you are self-hosting Nango, follow the instructions [here](/host/self-host/self-hosting-instructions) to change your callback URL.
