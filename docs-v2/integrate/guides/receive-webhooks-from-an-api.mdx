[External API webhooks](/understand/concepts/webhooks) let you support real-time updates and are sometimes the only integration option.

# Check if Nango supports webhooks for your API

Nango has off-the-shelf support for webhooks coming from [this list of APIs](/reference/webhooks).

<Tip>
The Nango team adds webhook support for new APIs in &lt;48h; simply ask in the [community](https://nango.dev/slack).

# Configure external webhooks

To send webhooks from an external API to Nango, you need to configure webhooks on the external API portal. For this, you need the Nango URL receiving webhooks, which can be found in your integration settings. 

# Forward external webhooks to your app

Webhooks received by Nango from external APIs are immediately forwarded to your backend ([step-by-step guide](/integrate/guides/receive-webhooks-from-nango) to receive webhooks from Nango).

Webhook forwarding is automatically enabled once you send webhooks from external APIs to Nango.  

Here is the body of a webhook from Nango forwarding a webhook from an API: 
```json
{
   "from": "hubspot",
   "type": "forward",
   "payload": ... // Raw payload from Hubspot wehook
```

# Handle external webhooks in syncs

In addition to webhook forwarding, you can use [syncs](/understand/concepts/syncs) to handle webhooks to create, update and delete data [records](/understand/concepts/syncs) in real-time.

Support for specific external webhook subscriptions must be added to each sync individually. You can check if a sync supports external webhooks by selecting your integration, going to the _Scripts_ tab, selecting the sync script, and checking in the sync script settings if it supports webhooks and, if so, which webhook subscription(s). 

Each modified record (following an external webhook) will trigger a separate _sync webhook_ from Nango to your app ([step-by-step guide](/integrate/guides/receive-webhooks-from-nango) to receive webhooks from Nango):
