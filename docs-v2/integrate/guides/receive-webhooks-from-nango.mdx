Nango sends [webhooks](/understand/concepts/webhooks) notifications to your backend in different cases:
- **Sync webhook**: new data from syncs is available
- **Authorization webhook**: an authorization flow completes (successfully & unsuccessfully)  
- **Webhook forwarding**: a webhook from an external API is received 

To set this up, go to the _Environment Settings_ tab and configure a _Webhook URL_ to which Nango will send notifications. 

<Tip>
Webhooks with non-2xx responses are retried with exponential backoff.
</Tip>

Webhooks from Nango are POST requests with the following body:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Sync webhook">
```json
{
    "type": "sync",
    "connectionId": "<string>",
    "providerConfigKey": "<string>",
    "syncName": "<string>",
    "model": "<string>",
    "responseResults": { "<DataModel>": { "added": 123, "updated": 123, "deleted": 123 } },
    "syncType": "INITIAL" | "INCREMENTAL",
    "modifiedAfter": "<timestamp>"
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Authorization webhook">

<Info>
Authorization webhooks must be enabled in the _Environment Settings_ tab of the Nango UI.
</Info>

```json
{
    "type": "auth",
    "connectionId": "<string>",
    "authMode": "OAUTH2|",
    "providerConfigKey": "<string>",
    "provider": "<string>",
    "environment": "prod|dev",
    "success": boolean,
    "operation": "creation|override|unknown",
    "error": "<string|undefined>"
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Webhook Forwarding">

<Info>

</Info>

```json
{
   "from": "hubspot",
   "type": "forward",
   "payload": ... // Raw payload from Hubspot webhook
}
```
</Tab>

# Verify webhooks from Nango

Validate webhook provenance by looking at the `X-Nango-Signature` header. It's a SHA-256 hash generated with the secret key found in your settings and with the payload of the request body:

```typescript
import crypto from 'crypto';

const secretKeyDev = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx';
const signature = `${secretKeyDev}${JSON.stringify(payload)}`;
const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(signature).digest('hex');
```

Accept the webhooks if the `X-Nango-Signature` header value matches the hash.
