# Create a free Nango account

Sign up for a free Nango account (**this feature is free & unlimited**, no credit card needed):
[![Try Nango Cloud](/images/nango-deploy-button.svg)](https://app.nango.dev/signup)

# Create an integration

Go to the _Integrations_ tab, choose to configure a new [integration](/understand/concepts/integrations), and choose an API to integrate with.

<Tip>
    Each API has a dedicated Nango documentation page with useful links, gotchas, etc.
</Tip>

APIs have different ways to authorize requests: OAuth, API key, Basic, custom. Nango abstracts away the difficulties of working with each one.

**For OAuth**

OAuth APIs require you to register your OAuth application on their developer portal.

When registering, the API provider will prompt you for the `Callback URL`. Use the one displayed in the Nango integration settings. Remember to register the required scopes in the Nango integration settings and, if necessary, with the API provider.

Collect your OAuth app's `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from the API portal and input them in your Nango integration settings.

**For API Key & Basic**

No configuration is necessary for APIs supporting API key & Basic authorization.

**For Custom Authorization**

APIs like Stripe & GitHub Apps have custom authorization. Configurations vary and are described in the Nango integration settings.

# Test the authorization

<Tip>
Your can test the authorization flow directly in the Nango UI, using your own external account credentials.

In production, the authorization flow will be triggered from your app, promping each of your customers' to enter their external account credentials (cf. next section).
</Tip>

On the Nango integration page, click `Add Connection` to test the authorization. After authorizing API access for one of the modes described below, a [connection](/understand/concepts/connections) should be successfully created in the _Connections_ tab.

**For OAuth**

Input your external account credentials in the popup dialog to test the authorization.

**For API Key & Basic**

Input the API key (or username/password for Basic) to test the authorization.

**For Custom Authorization**

The authorization flow will vary based on the API, but you will most likely have to log in to your external account via a popup dialog.

# Authorize users from your app

Nango Connect requires a unique temporary token to securely authenticate your users.

<img src="/images/connect-ui/steps.png" alt="Nango Connect UI required steps" />

<Tip>You can check a live implementation in our <a href="https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app?rel=connect-ui-guide"> Sample App</a></Tip>

## Step 1: Generate a Session token

To securely authenticate your users, we need a dedicated token generated on your backend and passed to the frontend. This security measure allows us to strictly identify authenticated users and pre-filter allowed integrations.

On **your backend**, you need an API endpoint that your frontend contacts, which will then communicate with the Nango API. Once you get back the token, forward it to Nango Connect.
This token has a lifespan of 30 minutes after which it expires.

```javascript
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

const nango = new Nango({ secretKey: process.env['NANGO_SECRET_KEY'] });

api.post('/sessionToken', (req, res) => {
  // Ask Nango for a secure token
  const res = await nango.createConnectSession({
    end_user: {
      id: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      display_name: user.displayName,
    },
    allowed_integrations: ['bamboohr'],
  });

  // Send this token back to your frontend
  res.status(200).send({
    sessionToken: res.data.token
  });
});
```

## Step 2: Trigger Auth Flow

In **your frontend**, you need to load our SDK and open Nango Connect

```js
import Nango from '@nangohq/frontend';

const nango = new Nango({ publicKey: process.env.PUBLIC_NANGO_PUBLIC_KEY });

function setSessionToken(connect) {
  const res = await fetch('/sessionToken', { method: 'POST' });
  connect.setSessionToken(res.sessionToken);
}

const connect = nango.openConnectUI();
await setSessionToken(connect);
```

<Tip>It's recommended to set the `sessionToken` asynchronously to be able to display the UI loading to your users before it's ready for better UX</Tip>

## Step 3: Link Connection ID to your user

In **your frontend**, the Connect UI will send back an event when a user connects or closes the modal. You can register an event listener and respond appropriately.

When a user completes a flow, you will receive a `connect` event. This event contains the `providerConfigKey`, which is the id of your integration and a `connectionId`, which is the auto-generated id that represents the couple user + integration.

```js
[...]

function saveConnectionId(authResults) {
  await fetch('/connection', { method: 'POST', body: authResults });
}

nango.openConnectUI({
  sessionToken: await getSessionToken(),

  // Listen to events
  onEvent: (event) => {
    if (event.type === 'connect') {
      void saveConnectionId(event.payload);
    }
  },
});
```

In your backend, associate this connectionId to your end user.

```javascript
api.post('/connection', (req, res) => {
  await User.update({
    connectionId: req.body.connectionId,
    integrationId: req.body.providerConfigKey,
  });

  res.status(200).send({
    success: true
  });
});
```

<Tip>If you have multiple integrations you will have to store multiple `connectionId`s</Tip>

## Listen for webhooks

Your backend is notified by Nango when an authorization attempt is completed, successful or not.

To set this up:
1. go to the _Environment Settings_ tab
2. specify a _Webhook URL_ to which Nango will send notifications
3. listen for webhooks in your backend at the specified route
4. enable the "Send New Connection Creation Webhooks" checkbox

Nango webhooks are post requests with the following JSON body:
```json
{
    "type": "auth",
    "connectionId": "<CONNECTION-ID>",
    "authMode": "OAUTH1|OAUTH2|OAUTH2_CC|BASIC|API_KEY|APP_STORE|CUSTOM|APP|NONE|TBA",
    "providerConfigKey": "<INTEGRATION-ID>",
    "provider": "<API-CONFIGURATION-ID>",
    "environment": "dev" | "prod",
    "success": true | false,
    "operation": "creation" | "override" | "unknown",
    "error": "<ERROR>"
}
```

For each successful authorization attempt, persist the connection ID & integration ID in your database. You will need them to retrieve the connection credentials later.

<Info>
Before using Nango in production, we advise [verifying webhook signatures](/integrate/guides/advanced/verify-webhooks-from-nango).

# You are ready

Your users can now launch Nango Connect and connect to any of your integrations, Nango is taking care of the rest.
