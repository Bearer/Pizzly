---

Get started quickly with Nango by looking at our sample application.
This [repository](https://github.com/NangoHQ/sample-app) provides a practical demonstration of integrating Nango into your codebase. It includes Syncs scripts, a backend API for managing Nango's webhooks, and a straightforward frontend for user interaction and data retrieval.

## Highlights

- Folder `nango-integrations/`
To use Nango you need some integrations, this folder (setup with our [CLI](./reference/cli)) contains the scripts that will fetch your users' data.

- Folder `back-end/`
To ingegrate with Nango you need a backend that will listen to Nango's [webhooks](./understand/concepts/webhooks) and interact with our [API](./reference/overview).

- Folder `front-end/`
Finally to let your user connect to your integration you need a frontend and call to our [auth library](./integrate/guides/authorize-an-api).
