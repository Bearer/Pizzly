---

Jumpstart your integration with Nango by exploring our sample application, which includes a front-end, a back-end, and integrations.

## Highlights

- **`front-end/` folder**: Features a frontend interface where users can connect to integrations and visualize external data.

- **`back-end/` folder**: Includes a backend API that receives Nango's [webhooks](/understand/concepts/webhooks), fetches the latest data from the Nango API, persists it in a database, and powers the frontend.

- **`nango-integrations/` folder**: Contains integration scripts that are deployed to Nango using the [CLI](/reference/cli), syncing data between Nango and external APIs.
