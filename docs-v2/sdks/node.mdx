The Node SDK lets you retrieve API credentials & data, as well as work with [Connections](/core-concepts#connections) from your backend.

# Installing & instantiating the node SDK

Install it with your favorite package manager, e.g.:

```bash
npm i -S @nangohq/node
```

Instantiate the `Nango` class:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Nango Cloud" >

```js
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

let nango = new Nango({ secretKey: '<SECRET-KEY>' });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Localhost" >

```js
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

let nango = new Nango({ host: 'http://localhost:3003' });
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Self-hosted" >

```js
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node';

let nango = new Nango({ host: '<NANGO-HOST-AND-PORT>' });
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auth

### Retrieve API credentials

The easiest and fastest way to get the current API credentials.

For OAuth 2 integrations this will return you the current access token (already refreshed if needed). For API key based integrations it will return the API key.
For OAuth 1.0a integrations it will return you a small object with the neccessary details to sign the request.

```js
let creds = await nango.getToken('<INTEGRATION-ID>', '<CONNECTION-ID>');
```

<Tip>
**Always fetch the current access_token from Nango before you run an API request.**  
We refresh the token if needed. Caching it on your side could lead to failed requests.
</Tip>

### Retrieve Connection details

Use this method to retrieve all the details Nango stores on a specific Connection:

```js
let connection = await nango.getConnection(
    '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    '<CONNECTION-ID>',
    '<FORCE_REFRESH?: boolean>', // Optional: attempt to refresh the access access token regardless of its expiration status, defaults to false
    '<REFRESH_TOKEN?: boolean>', // Optional: return the refresh token as part of the response, defaults to false
);
```

Please check the [REST API reference](/api-reference/connection/get) for an example response and the full list of returned fields.


### List all connections for a user

```js
let list = await nango.listConnections('<CONNECTION-ID>');
```

This returns you all [Connections](/core-concepts#connections) of a specific user (i.e. Connection ID):

```js
{
    connections: [
        {
            connection_id: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
            provider: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
            created: '2023-03-08T09:43:03.725Z'
        },
        // ...
    ];
}
```

### List all connections

```js
let list = await nango.listConnections();
```

Returns a list of minimalistic [Connection](/core-concepts#connections) objects. This can be helpful if you need to check whether a user has setup a specific [Integration](/core-concepts#integrations). Note that the list does not contain any access credentials and fetching it also does not refresh the access tokens of any Connections.

Please check the [REST API reference](/api-reference/connection/list) for an example response and the full list of returned fields.

### Retrieve Integration details

Use this method to retrieve all the details Nango stores on a specific Integration:

```js
let integration = await nango.getIntegration(
    '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    '<INCLUDE-INTEGRATION-CREDENTIALS?: boolean>', // Optional: if true, the response will contain the client ID, secret and scopes (false by default).
);
```

Please check the [REST API reference](/api-reference/integration/get) for an example response and the full list of returned fields.
## Sync

### Nango Proxy

<Note>
    The Nango Proxy is not available for all APIs yet.  
    Check the API's [Integrations page](/integrations) (`Cmd + K` for search) to see if it is available for you API.

    If you need additional APIs supported please reach out on the [Slack community](https://www.nango.dev/slack): We can enable support within a few hours.
</Note>

To execute proxy requests, use:

```typescript
const res = await nango.proxy({
    method: 'POST',
    endpoint: '/calendar/v3/users/me/calendarList',
    providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
    connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>',
    headers: {
        Go: 'Here'
    },
    params: {
        query: 'params!'
    },
    retries: 5, // If response code != 200. Exponential backoff, default is 0
    data: {
        id: 1,
        colorId: 'blue',
        selected: true
    }
});
```

There are also convenience methods available: `nango.get({})`, `nango.post({})`, `nango.patch{{}}` and `nango.delete({})`.

**Return value**  
When you call the proxy Nango creates the API request to the external API and runs it for you (possibly with retries).

The response from the external API is passed back to you exactly as Nango gets it:
* Response code
* Response headers
* Response body

For the node SDK Nango returns an [Axios response object](https://axios-http.com/docs/res_schema).

### Read synced data

<Note>This feature is in private beta. Request access on the [community](https://nango.dev/slack).</Note>

To read synced data from Nango use `getRecords`:

```ts
const records = await nango.getRecords({
    providerConfigKey: '<integration-id>',  // Name of your integration, from nango.yaml. E.g. github
    connectionId: '<user-id>',              // The connection id you passed to nango.auth()
    model: '<model-name>',                  // The name of the data model, from nango.yaml. E.g. ticket
    delta: '<timestamp>'                    // Optional. Only return records added or updated since this timestamp. E.g. 2023-05-31T11:46:13.390Z
});

console.log(records);
```

If you are using the [Nango Sync webhooks](/nango-sync/guides/webhooks#from-nango) you can use the timestamp you get from the webhook for the `delta` parameter.
