## Installing the CLI

We recommend that you install the CLI globally by running `npm install nango -g`.

By default, the CLI assumes that you are using Nango Cloud so you need to set the `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` env variable or pass in the `--secret-key` flag with each command.

For self-hosting, set the `NANGO_HOSTPORT` env variable or pass in the --host flag with each command.

## All CLI commands & command details

Check out all CLI commands by running: 
```bash
nango
```

Get details about a specific command by running: 
```bash
nango [command] --help
```

## Run Nango locally

If you are only using Nango for OAuth, you can run Nango locally by running (cf. [Authorize APIs guide](/guides/sync)): 
```bash
nango start
```

If you are developing [Syncs](/core-concepts#syncs), instead run (cf. [Sync Data guide](/guides/sync)): 
```bash
nango dev
```

## Flags & environment variables

Your can use the following flags on every CLI command: 
```bash
--secret-key [secretKey] # Set the secret key. Overrides the `NANGO_SECRET_KEY` value set in the .env file
```
```bash
--host [host] # Set the host. Overrides the `NANGO_HOSTPORT` value set in the .env file
```
```bash
--auto-confirm # Auto confirm yes to all prompts (for CI).
```

You can also use the following environment variables (e.g. by adding an `.env` where you run the CLI):
```bash
NANGO_HOSTPORT=https://api.nango.dev | http://localhost:3003 | your-self-hosted-address
NANGO_AUTO_UPGRADE=true # upgrade the CLI automatically
NANGO_NO_PROMPT_FOR_UPGRADE=false # don't prompt for upgrades
NANGO_DEPLOY_AUTO_CONFIRM=false # deploy without any prompts
NANGO_SECRET_KEY=xxxx-xxx-xxxx # Required for Nango Cloud to authenticate
NANGO_INTEGRATIONS_LOCATION=use-this-to-override-where-the-nango-integrations-directory-goes # set a custom location for the nango-integrations directory
NANGO_PORT=use-this-to-override-the-default-3003 # set a custom port for the Nango Server
NANGO_DB_PORT=use-this-to-override-the-default-5432 # set a custom port for the Nango database
```
