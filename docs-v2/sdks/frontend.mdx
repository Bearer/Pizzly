The Nango frontend SDK is
[available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nangohq/frontend) with the
package `@nangohq/frontend`.

## Triggering OAuth flows

You trigger OAuth flows with `nango.auth`. This function returns a promise,
which resolves if the OAuth flow was successful, and rejects if there was an
error.

```js
nango
    .auth('<INTEGRATION-ID>', '<CONNECTION-ID>')
    .then((result) => {
        // result is an object with:
        // {
        //      providerConfigKey: '<INTEGRATION-ID>',
        //      connectionId: '<CONNECTION-ID>
        // }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        // Error is an object with:
        // {
        //    error: {
        //      type: 'authorization_cancelled', (or similar)
        //      message: 'Authorization fail: The user has closed the authorization modal before the process was complete.'  (or similar)
        //    }
        // }
    });
```

## OAuth flows requiring extra configuration

Some API Providers require some connection-specific configuration (e.g. Zendesk,
Shopify).

For example, Zendesk has the following authorization URL, where the subdomain is
specific to a user's Zendesk account:

```
https://<USER-SUBDOMAIN>.zendesk.com/oauth/authorizations/new
```

To set the subdomain pass in an additional configuration object to
`nango.auth()`:

```js
nango.auth('zendesk', '<CONNECTION-ID>', {
    params: { subdomain: '<ZENDESK-SUBDOMAIN>' }
});
```
