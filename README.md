## ⭐ Nango at a glance

Nango is a new way of building product integrations:

-   as **powerful** as building yourself
-   as **fast** as buying a pre-built solution

It supports:

-   🔐 Managed auth
-   🔁 Bi-directional syncing
-   🚫 Rate-limits & retries
-   📄 Pagination
-   🧠 Strong typing
-   🪝 Webhooks
-   👀 Monitoring
-   📺 Admin console

We built the [hard infrastructure](https://docs.nango.dev/core-concepts#infra), so you don't have to.

## 👩‍💻 How it looks in my code

-   1-liner to start a new OAuth flow:

```js
nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

-   1-liner to fetch structured objects from any external API:

```js
nango.github().issues('<user-id>');
```

## 100+ pre-configured APIs, easily add your own

Nango works with **any** API and use-case. Adding [Integration Templates](https://docs.nango.dev/core-concepts#templates) is easy and we already have the main APIs covered.

100+ APIs are pre-configured to work out-of-the-box, including:

-   **CRM**: Front, Hubspot, Salesforce, etc.
-   **Accounting**: Xero, Sellsy, Zoho Books, etc.
-   **Fintech:** Brex, Stripe, Braintree, Ramp etc.
-   **Developer tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Linear, Jira etc.
-   **Communication**: Gmail, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, Zoom etc.
-   **Productivity**: Asana, Airtable, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Trello,
    GSheet, ClickUp etc.

## 🐻 History

Pizzly (a simple service for OAuth) was initially developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40 individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since maintained and evolved it together with the growing Nango community.
