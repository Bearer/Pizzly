## Pizzly teams up with Hacktoberfest 2020

Pizzly is an API Integrations Manager focused on helping API developers build faster and more reliable API integrations. So far about 60 APIs are readily compatible with Pizzly. <strong>In October 2020, during Hacktoberfest, Pizzly aims to reach 100 APIs 🎉 </strong>

## How to participate?

Create an account on Hacktoberfest website then pick [one of the issues opened for that event](https://github.com/Bearer/Pizzly/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest). Your mission is to create a configuration file to make a new API readily available for Pizzly's developers.
