## Using Gmail with Nango

Gmail uses the same OAuth mechanism as other Google services. Please use the Google template for it in Nango: `google`  
Follow our [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to add an OAuth integration with the Gmail API in 5 minutes.

Supported features in Nango:

| Feature                            | Supported                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Auth](/nango-auth/core-concepts)  | ✅                        |
| [Proxy](/nango-unified-apis/proxy) | ✅                        |
| Unified APIs                       | _Not included in any yet_ |

## App registration & publishing

Google's APIs all use the same OAuth service. To which APIs you get access is determined by the scopes that you request.

Please check the main [Google OAuth API wiki](google.md) here for details on how to register an OAuth app with Google.
