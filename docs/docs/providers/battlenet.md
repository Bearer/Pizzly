## API specific gotchas

- Depending on the region you will want to connect to, you will have to provide the region as am extension in the config params.
   You should use `nango.auth('amazon', '1', {params: {extension: 'com.cn'}})`. The provided extension here is the shows that the region is china.
- Tokens cannot be refreshed, hence when token expires resource owners will have to go through to authorize flow again.
