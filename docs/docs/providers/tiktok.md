## Using TikTok with Nango

API template name in Nango: `tiktok`  
Follow our [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to add an OAuth integration with TikTok in 5 minutes.

Supported features in Nango:

| Feature                            | Supported                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Auth](/nango-auth/core-concepts)  | ✅                        |
| [Proxy](/nango-unified-apis/proxy) | ❎                        |
| Unified APIs                       | _Not included in any yet_ |

## App registration & publishing

[Register your app here](https://developers.tiktok.com/apps) and follow [these steps](https://developers.tiktok.com/doc/scopes-overview/) to enable the API and add the scopes you need.

You need to submit your app for review (see developer docs) before it is publicly available.

## API specific gotchas

-   The TikTok "App Id" is _not_ the `client_id`. TikTok calls the `client_id` the Client key and you should pass this value to Nango as the `client_id`.
-   Make sure you pre-register your scopes in your app's config, otherwise the flow will fail when you ask for them.
