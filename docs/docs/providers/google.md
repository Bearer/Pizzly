-   [Google scopes](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes)

## API specific gotchas

-   Google has a unified OAuth system for their various APIs. This provider should work for most of them (e.g. GSheet, Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.)
-   You need to enable individual Google API on the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) before using them
-   While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ should be your site URL (`http://localhost:8000` if you're doing the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) locally)
