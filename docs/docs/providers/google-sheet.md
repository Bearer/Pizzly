## API specific gotchas

-   While setting up the OAuth app, use the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` scope for extended capabilities
-   While setting up the OAuth credentials, the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ should be your site URL (`http://localhost:8000` if you're doing the [Quickstart](../quickstart.md) locally)
