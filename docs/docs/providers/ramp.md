## Using Ramp with Nango

API template name in Nango: `ramp`  
Or, if you are connecting to the Sandbox/Demo system, use `ramp-sandbox`  
Follow our [quickstart](../quickstart.md) to add an OAuth integration with Ramp in 5 minutes.

Supported features in Nango:

| Feature                            | Supported                 |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Auth](/nango-auth/core-concepts)  | ✅                        |
| [Proxy](/nango-unified-apis/proxy) | ❎                        |
| Unified APIs                       | _Not included in any yet_ |

## App registration & publishing

To register an OAuth app it seems you need a Ramp account.
As a workaround you can use the [sandbox access form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddatpB56ClpJnrPdhgqApvxH_tQdeAcbEFqki-ftPMRrmX7g/viewform) (link mentioned [here](https://docs.ramp.com/developer-api/v1/overview/getting-started)) to get in touch with the Ramp team and ask for a dev account.
