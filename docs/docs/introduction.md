# Nango: The open-source unified API.

Dozens of pre-built API integrations for your app. Easily extend, customize and build your own.

## ‚≠ê Nango at a glance

Nango is a service for easy integrations with external APIs:

Leverage dozens of pre-built use cases with our unified APIs. Or extend them and build entirely custom integrations on top of our open, scalable platform.

With Nango you get:

-   pre-built unified APIs for many use cases (CRM, Ticketing, HRIS etc.)
-   a pre-built OAuth service for all supported APIs (can also be used standalone)
-   support for 90+ external APIs
-   extensible platform to build your own, custom unified APIs

Nango is easy to try in 5 minutes:

-   1-liner to start a new (O)Auth flow in your frontend (supports all 90+ external APIs):

```ts
let result = await nango.auth('github', '<user-id>');
```

-   in your backend, easily fetch always up to date data with our fully typed SDK:

```ts
let contacts = await nango.crm.getContacts('<user-id>');
```

-   or only use the (O)Auth service and make any API call with the access token (or [proxy](nango-unified-apis/proxy)):

```ts
let token = await nango.getToken('github', '<user-id>');
```

## üêª History

Pizzly was originally developed by the team at [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com/?ref=pizzly) with contributions of more than 40+ individuals. Over time the focus of Bearer shifted and they could no longer maintain Pizzly. In late 2022 the team at [Nango](https://www.nango.dev) adopted the project and has since developed it together with the growing Nango community.
